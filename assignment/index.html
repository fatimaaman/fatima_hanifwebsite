       The healthy one or the one with a blocked nose.

  <p>Nowadays, there is a misconception around the term ‘diet’. People say being on a diet means you have to eat less but that is not the case. Diet is anything you eat and a balanced diet is including carbohydrates,
    fats, fiber, protein, water, vitamins and minerals in your diet. </p>

<p>Good sleep will not only benefit you physically but also will have
  a huge impact on your emotional well-being. How many times have you sacrificed sleep
so you could get more work done? Sleep should not be taken lightly since it affects
our lives more than anything. If you do not sleep well, doing simple tasks can be tiring.</p>
